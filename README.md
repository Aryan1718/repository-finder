# Project Description
This project helps users find the desired GitHub repository. The goal is to create a website where users can easily search for projects and view all related repositories without the need to browse the internet. To develop this application, I used React.js, CSS, and HTML. I utilized the Fetch API to generate responses. The main aim of this project was to gain experience with the Fetch API and React.js.

# Future Updates
Make the user interface responsive and add more components to the website.

Add filtering options to the search bar so users can narrow their searches and find the desired outcomes.
